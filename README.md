# Rishidot Research Decision Makers Guide
Rishidot Research's Decision Makers' Guides are research briefs made to help decision makers gain quick understanding of a technology or compare two or more technologies. The guides are designed to help modern enterprise decision makers quickly understand the pros and cons of specific technologies or scenarios to plan their strategy. Unlike Rishidot Research's long form reports, these guides are purposed to inform decision makers about the strengths and weaknesses of specific technologies. This understanding will empower them and their teams to make objective strategic decisions without depending on vendor marketing materials. When decision makers want a deep dive into specific technologies or need to evaluate various scenarios as part of their planning process, Rishidot Research can aid that process through consulting engagements.
